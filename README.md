# Wordpress Headless Pages Plugin

This Wordpress plugin is designed to be used when WP is deployed as a Headless CMS.

Using [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com) provides fine-grained control for content modeling;
this plugin disables the default 'content' field as well as excerpts, trackbacks, comments and other unneeded fields from
the default page edit view.
